description: Overview page to introduce Distirbuted tracing in Tyk
---

Distributed tracing is a method of tracking application requests as they flow from frontend devices to backend services and databases. It is used to monitor and troubleshoot requests end-to-end.

Tyk currently supports OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing for distributed tracing. Support for OpenTelemetry is available since Tyk 5.2+. If you have any comments and suggestions for this feature, please leave a comment on this [community forum post](https://community.tyk.io/t/faq-opentelemetry-distributed-tracing/5682).

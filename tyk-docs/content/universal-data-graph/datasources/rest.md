The REST Datasource is a base component of UDG to help you add existing REST APIs to your data graph. By attaching a REST datasource to a field the engine will use the REST resource for resolving.

We have a video which demoes this functionality for you.

## Using external REST API as a Datasource

In order to use an external REST API as a Datasource you need to first navigate to the field which that Datasource should be attached to. 

1. Click on the field which should have a datasource attached
2. From the right-hand side *Configure data source* panel choose REST at the bottom in the *Add a new external data source* section

3. Provide data source name, URL, method to be used. Optionally you can add headers information and configure field mapping

4. Click the *Save & Update API* button to persist the configuration and generate a REST resolver, to  resolve this field at runtime.

## Using Tyk REST API as a Datasource

1. Click on the field which should have a datasource attached
2. From the right-hand side *Configure data source* panel choose *REST | Tyk* dropdown to see all available APIs

3. Choose which Tyk REST API you want to attach
4. Provide data source name, endpoint and method to be used. Optionally you can add headers information and configure field mapping

5. Click the *Save & Update API* button to persist the configuration and generate a REST resolver, to resolve this field at runtime.

Once done the field you just configured will show information about data source type and name:

## Automatically creating REST UDG configuration based on OAS specification

Tyk Dashboard users have an option to use Tyk Dashboard API and quickly transform REST API OAS specification into a UDG config and have it published in the Dasboard within seconds.

See our [Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/tyk-technologies/workspace/tyk-public-workspace/overview) and fork `Tyk Dashboard API v5.1`.

The endpoint you need to use is:

```bash
POST /api/data-graphs/data-sources/import
```

Request body:

```json
{
    "type": "string",
    "data": "string"
}
```

`type` is an enum with the following possible values:

- openapi
- asyncapi

To import an OAS specification you need to choose `openapi`.

If you are using Postman and your OAS document is in `yaml` format you can use a simple pre-request script to transform it into a `string`.

```bash
pm.environment.set("oas_document", JSON.stringify(`<your_yaml_goes_here>`))
```

Then your request body will look like this:

```json
{
    "type": "openapi",
    "data": {{oas_document}}
}
```
